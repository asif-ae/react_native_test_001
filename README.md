## ðŸš€ Building the APK

To build the release APK for Android, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Build Script**: A custom script is provided in `package.json` for building the APK. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This script navigates to the `android` directory, runs the Gradle `assembleRelease` task, and then navigates back to the root directory.

2. **Locate the APK**: After the build is complete, the APK file will be generated at:
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk
   ```

3. **Install the APK**:
   - Transfer the APK to your Android device.
   - Install the APK file by opening it on your device.

4. **Test the App**:
   - Launch the installed app and verify all the features.
